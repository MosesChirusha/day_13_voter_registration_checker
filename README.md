# Voter Registration Checker – Uganda (Day 13)

Offline-first civic information tool that helps citizens understand voter
registration requirements and how to confirm their status through official
channels.

Built as part of a 90-day challenge to create practical digital solutions.

---

## Problem
As elections approach, many citizens are unsure whether they are registered to
vote, what documents are required, or where to confirm their status. This
uncertainty can prevent eligible voters from participating.

---

## Solution
A simple browser-based voter registration information portal that:
- Explains voter eligibility requirements
- Provides a readiness checklist
- Shares official steps to verify registration status
- Highlights key election dates
- Works offline for information access

This tool does **not** access or verify voter records.
